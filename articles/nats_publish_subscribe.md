# Publish-Subscribe

NATS implements a publish-subscribe message distribution model for one-to-many communication. A publisher sends a message on a subject and any active subscriber listening on that subject receives the message. Subscribers can also register interest in wildcard subjects that work a bit like a regular expression \(but only a bit\). This one-to-many pattern is sometimes called fan-out.
